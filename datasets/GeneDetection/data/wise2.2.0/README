DEVELOPEMENT
------------

The Wise2 package is now in its sunset period. I am only doing bug
fixes on it. I have not had a proper "serious" bug in the code base
for around 2 years (there is an outstanding issue with memory in HMMs
on certain HMM types not delt with)


My active coding has moved to the exonerate code base (Guy Slater
being the lead developer there). Many of the ideas and concepts behind
Wise2 I hope will make it into the exonerate code base eventually.


The Wise2.2 series therefore will be a slow moving release series,
mainly focused on providing support for Ensembl, as well as providing
a "rock solid" genewise implementation.
