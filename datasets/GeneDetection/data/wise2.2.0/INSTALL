This README tells you how to install the wise2 on your
own system.


You have picked up the source distribution all you need to do cd into
src and type 'make all'. This should only fail if

a) You don't have a ANSI C compiler installed as cc.  In which case
see if you have gcc installated, and if so, edit the makefile in this
directory to say CC = gcc rather than CC = cc

b) You don't have a make program that allows recursion into
directories (some old Sun systems did this). Install gnu make.



--------------------------------------------------------------

Installing with Pthreads support


To install with Pthreads, you need to edit the top of the makefile
in this directory. Basically you need to comment out the areas
it says (by adding a # at the start of hte line) and uncomment
the areas it says to uncomment. Then 'make all' should make it
fine.
