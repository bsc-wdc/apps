* 9  - genData: Generates data and runs kmeans
* 10 - genData2: Generates data and runs kmeans (Version 2)
* 11 - tensorflow: Implementation using tensorflow
* 12 - latest: Latest version
* 13 - latest_oo: Object oriented latest version (common version with dataClay)
* 14 - latest_files: Latest version with dataset from files
* 15 - apps: Latest version
* 16 - apps_mergereduce: Latest version with merge-reduce
* 17 - apps_initmodes: Latest version with init modes (random, kmeans++ ||, kmeans++)
* 18 - official: Official version

== Execution instructions ==
Usage:
kmeans.py <numPoints> <dim> <k> <fragments>

where:
                 * - numPoints: number of points
                 * - dim: dimension of the points (2)
                 * - fragments: number of fragments
                 * - k: number of centers

== Build ==
No build is required
