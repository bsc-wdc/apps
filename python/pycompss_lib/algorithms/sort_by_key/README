sortByKey

== Versions ==
* - base: base version
* - 2_hash: base version with hashed partitioning
* - 3_files: Sort N files (with pickled content)
* - 4_sortNumpy: Sort N files (with pickled content) with numpy using mergesort algorithm. Also alternatives for N times.

* - 6_sortByKey: Final version with automatic dataset generation and from files (with pickled content).
 
== Execution instructions ==                                                                                        
Usage (6_sortByKey):

sort.py <numKeys> <uniqueKeys> <keyLenght> <uniqueValues> <valueLenght> <numFragments> <randomSeed> <fromFiles> <path>

                 * - numKeys: Number of keys
                 * - uniqueKeys: Number of unique keys
                 * - keyLenght: Length of the keys (bytes)
                 * - uniqueValues: Number of unique values
                 * - valueLenght: Length of the values (bytes)
                 * - numFragments: Number of fragments
                 * - randomSeed: Random seed
                 * - fromFiles: Boolean from files dataset (If true, ignores the previous parameters)
                 * - path: Dataset path
