[Body]
 == Description ==
Parallel Word Count. Read file by the worker.

== Versions ==
There are three versions of wordcount, depending on the reduce type and the number of files used in the algorithm.
=== Version 1 ===
''reduce'', where the reduce task is done by a sequential algorithm.
=== Version 2 ===
''merge'', where the reduce task is done by a merge tree algorithm.
=== Version 3 ===
''chunkFile'', where the input can be a single file or multiple files. If it's a single file, the wordcount task reads a chunk.


== Execution instructions ==
Usage:
runcompss reduce/wordcount.py <path>
runcompss merge/wordcount.py <path>
runcompss chunkFile/wordcount.py <path> <multipleFiles> [<sizeChunk>]

where:
                 * - path: Dataset path
                 * - multipleFiles: True or False
                 * - sizeChunk: if Multiple Files, chunk's size in bytes


== Execution Example ==
runcompss chunkFile/wordcount.py /data/text_15500.txt False 1024


== Build ==
No build is required
