[Body]
== Description ==
NGS Analyzer-Mini adapted to PyCOMPSs

== Versions ==
* - 0_initial: First version of the original MPI workflow respecting the original tasks structure
* - 1_base: this version has been changed and adapted to COMPSs' potentiality by creating more tasks
* - 2_base_buckets: (UNFINISHED) like 1_base but grouping tasks in the second part of the workflow (remove duplicates and analyze)

== Execution instructions ==
Usage:
runcompss --pythonpath=<PATH_TO_BIN> ngsa-mini-py <BWA_DB_FILE> <CONTIG_FILE> <REFERENCE_FILE> <REFERENCE_INDEX_FILE> <INPUT_DIR> <NUM_FOLDERS>

where:
	 * - PATH_TO_BIN: full path to workflow.py file, ie /full/path/to/this/folder/0_initial/src or /full/path/to/this/folder/1_base/src
	 * - BWA_DB_FILE, CONTIG_FILE, REFERENCE_FILE, REFERENCE_INDEX_FILE: paths to different input files
	 * - INPUT_DIR: path to folder containing rank-based inputs
	 * - NUM_FOLDERS: number of folders in INPUT_DIR

Example:

runcompss --pythonpath=/home/compss/apps/ngsa-mini-py/bin /home/compss/apps/ngsa-mini-py/bin/workflow.py ./input/bwa_db/reference.fa ./input/seq_contig.md ./input/reference.fa ./input/reference.fa.fai ./input/00-read-rank/ 8

*** In Mare Nostrum, check launch_mn.sh script to enqueue the execution.

== Build ==
No build is required
