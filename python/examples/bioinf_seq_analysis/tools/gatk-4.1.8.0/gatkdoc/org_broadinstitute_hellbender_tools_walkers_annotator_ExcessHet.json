  "description": "Phred-scaled p-value for exact test of excess heterozygosity.\n\n \u003cp\u003eThis annotation estimates the probability of the called samples exhibiting excess heterozygosity with respect to the null hypothesis that the samples are unrelated. The higher the score, the\n higher the chance that the variant is a technical artifact or that there is consanguinuity among the samples. In\n contrast to Inbreeding Coefficient, there is no minimal number of samples for this annotation. If samples are known to be related, a pedigree file can be provided so\n that the calculation is only performed on founders and offspring are excluded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eStatistical notes\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eThis annotation uses the implementation from\n \u003ca href\u003d\u0027http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929707607356?via%3Dihub\u0027\u003eWigginton JE, Cutler DJ, Abecasis GR. \u003ci\u003eA Note on Exact Tests of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium.
