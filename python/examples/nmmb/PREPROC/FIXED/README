The programs in this directory define the geographical data that
do not change in time on the model grid.  The raw data used for 
this purpose are located in the directory ../geodata.  The output
fields are stored in the directory ../output that you have to
create first.

The .inc files define the model grid and the data grids.

To define the fields on the model grid run the interactive script
RUNFIXED.  This takes some time since huge data files are
processed.  However this needs to be done only the first time the
specific model grid is used. The output fields have recognizable 
names.

N.B.
If you use the GFDL Eta radiation, you will need precomputed co2
transmission functions for your specific distribution of model
levels.  To get the transmission functions, later on you can set
the appropriate flag in the model configuration file to 1. 
Alternatively, you can run the script runco2 in this directory.
For this you need the input data that are in ../geodata/co2data 
and the file ../output/dsg that is not available yet, but will be
defined after running the program allprep.f in the directory
../vrbl807.  The file lmimjm.inc describes the model grid for the
f70 program gfdlco2.f and must agree with the modelgrid.inc file
used in the f90 programs.  For further instructions see the N.B.
in ../vrbl807/README.
