The programs in this directory prepare initial conditions for model
runs and other data that change in time.  

The grib data are fetched from NCEP ftp sites.  Please change the
e-mail address for anonymous ftp in get* scripts.

The geographical data are taken from the directory ../geodata.  The
intermediate and final fields are stored in the directory ../output,
except for the sst grib data that are fetched to this directory.

The data grids and the model grid are defined in *.inc files.  The
file lmimjm.inc defines the model grid for the f77 programs, and 
must agree with the file modelgrid.inc used in f90 programs.

The following interactive scripts do the first part of preprocessing
depending on domain size and cycle time:

PREPGLOB00 (global domain)
PREPGLOB12 (global domain)
PREPREG00  (regional domain)
PREPREG12  (regional domain)

For reginal domain set the parameters that define the boundary
conditions in PREPREG* in getgfs and degribgfs and ihrend in 
allprep.f

!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
      ihr=0
      if(global) then
        ihrend=0
      else
        ihrend=48
      endif
      ihboco=3
      tboco=ihboco*3600.
      rtboco=1./tboco
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Run the appropriate interactive script depending on domain size and 
cycle time:

PREPGLOB00 (global domain)
PREPGLOB12 (global domain)
PREPREG00  (regional domain)
PREPREG12  (regional domain)

Then run the batch job allprep.f by 

llsubmit run

Don't forget to edit the run script the first time if necessary.

N.B.
The file ../output/dsg is now available and if you wish you can go
back to the directory ../fixed807 and run the script runco2 to
generate the co2 transmission functions for the GFDL Eta radiation.
