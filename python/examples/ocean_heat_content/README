[Body]
== Description ==
Ocean Heat Content is a tool that analyses the heat variations in the surface
of the sea.
Uses Numba to improve the performance of the analysis, and it is also able
to exploit the usage of GPUs.

== Versions ==
* - per_layer: base paralelized considering each layer computation as a task.
* - all_layers: simpler version that considers the computation of all task
                of each input file within a task.

== Execution instructions ==
Usage:
per_layer/oceanheatcontent.py <DATASET_FOLDER> <MESH_FILE> <REGIONS_FILE> <OUTPUT_FOLDER>
all_layers/oceanheatcontent.py <DATASET_FOLDER> <MESH_FILE> <REGIONS_FILE> <OUTPUT_FOLDER> <ONLY_GPU>

where:
                 * - DATASET_FOLDER: Input dataset path.
                 * - MESH_FILE: Mesh file path.
                 * - REGIONS_FILE: Regions file path.
                 * - OUTPUT_FOLDER: Ouput folder where to store the results.
                 * - ONLY_GPU: Use only GPUs (True | False). If false, uses only CPUs.

== Build ==
No build is required
