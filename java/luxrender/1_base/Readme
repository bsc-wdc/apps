[Body]
 == Description ==
LuxRender is an open source rendering engine based on Ray Tracing algorithm for image synthesis.The sequential application takes an input file (.lxf scene file) which contains several parameters including the required data as materials, textures etc, the number of samples to be processed and the quality of the final rendered file. This input file is passed to the renderer binary that produces a .flm file that can be then transformed to an image raster.

The COMPSs application parallelizes the run executing N rendering tasks of the same scene, each with a reduced number of samples, and merge the partial .flm results at the end with a 2-by-2 reduction using a LuxRender specific binary. The result will be a .flm file whereby the resulting sample/pixel count is the sum of the sample/pixel count for all the films merged.

The application contains the following tasks:
	– Render: processes the whole scene with a quality fixed in the input file. The ""luxconsole"" binary is used.
	– Merge: merges the partial results of two rendering tasks using the ""luxmerger"" binary.
	A final processes generates a raster image file from the merged .flm file.

== Execution instructions ==
Usage:
runcompss luxrender.LuxRender <debug> <binary> <lxs_modelfile> <simultaneous_renders> <tmpdir> <output_image>

where:
		 * - debug: Set the debug mode on
		 * - binary: LuxRender binaries location
		 * - lxs_modelfile: Input LXS full path model
		 * - simultaneous_renders: Number of Worker processes
		 * - tmpdir: Temporary directory
		 * - output_image: Output raster file
		

== Execution Example ==
runcompss luxrender.LuxRender true /home/user/binary/ /sharedDisk/LuxRender/frankgehry-statacenter/frankgehry-statacenter.lxs 2 /home/user/tmp/ /sharedDisk/LuxRender/frankgehry-statacenter/results/frankgehry-statacenter.png
