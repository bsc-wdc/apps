== Description ==
The NAS parallel benchmarks (NPB) are a set of kernels that evaluate diverse computation and communication patterns, and they are widely used for parallel performance benchmarking. Four of these kernels were implemented in sequential Java to be executed with COMPSs:
1. Embarrassingly Parallel (EP): a test for computation performance that generates pseudorandom floating point numbers and has few communications.
2. Fast Fourier Transform (FT): this benchmark tests computation performance by solving a differential equation with FFTs and communication by sending large messages.
3. Integer Sort (IS): this kernel also tests computation, but especially communication performance. It sorts a large array of integers and is characterised by numerous transfers.
4. Conjugate Gradiant (CG): it estimates the smallest eigenvalue of a large sparse symmetric positive-definite matrix using the inverse iteration with the conjugate gradient method as a subroutine for solving systems of linear equations.


== Build ==
=== Option 1: Native java ===
cd ~/workspace_java/npb/; javac src/main/java/npb/*.java
cd src/main/java/; jar cf npb.jar npb/
cd ../../../; mv src/main/java/npb.jar jar/

=== Option 2: Maven ===
cd ~/workspace_java/npb/
mvn clean package
