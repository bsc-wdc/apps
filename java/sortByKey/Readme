[Body]
 == Description ==
Sort an input of the form {key, value} by key

== Versions ==
There is only one version of sortByKey but several implementations 
are available and can be found in the readme within.

== Build ==

The .jar files are build with Maven.

cd /PATH_TO_JAVA_APPS/sort_by_key/
mvn clean package

== Scripts usage ==

Interactive script: launch.sh

Although we showed how to execute an application with runcompss in each subdirectory,
we strongly recommend to use the available bash scripts on the top of each application directory.
To run an application with the scripts, do the following:

        cd /PATH_TO_JAVA_APPS/sortByKey   # change directory to the application top directory
        ./launch.sh VERSION_TO_EXECUTE IMPLEMENTATION_TO_EXECUTION APP_ARGS # VERSION_TO_EXECUTE it is 'base' in case that the version is '1_base'
