[Body]
== Description ==
Given a directory, this application parses all the files in it and writes all the links found in a result output file.
Files are distributed in a given number of chunks. Chunks of files are processed in parallel. 
Later, once processed, chunks are merge to a final result file. Merging tasks are done also in parallel.
In the result file, after each link appears the filename of the files that contains that link. 

Arguments:
	1. Debug: if true, prints debug information
	2. Website path: path to the directory where to read the files from
	3. Chunks: number of chunks when processing files
	4. Output filename: filename for the result file where the application merges all the links found
	5. Temp directory: directory where the application writes the (*.part) temporary files

== Build ==

Change to the version directory you want to compile and execute:

	mvn clean package

All the .jar files needed by the application will be automatically generated.

== Execution instructions ==
The test directory under this project contains 3 html pages to be parsed as example.
We assume that you are going to execute the application in its main directory, so ${PWD} inthis case could be resolved as /PATH_TO_JAVA_APPS/reverseIndex/1_base/ .

runcompss -d --classpath=${PWD}/lib/htmllexer-2.1.jar:${PWD}/lib/htmlparser-2.1.jar:${PWD}/reverse.jar reverse.Reverse true /home/mdomingu/git/apps/java/reverseIndex/1_base/test 3 /home/mdomingu/git/apps/java/reverseIndex/1_base/out.txt /tmp

== Dependencies ==

For compilation and/or execution there are some jars listed in the maven dependencies, theyare automatically downloaded. 

* htmlparser.jar
