[Body]
== Description ==
Given a directory, this application parses all the files in it and writes all the links found in a result output file.
Files are distributed in a given number of chunks. Chunks of files are processed in parallel. 
Later, once processed, chunks are merge to a final result file. Merging tasks are done also in parallel.
In the result file, after each link appears the filename of the files that contains that link. 

== Versions ==
There is only one version and one implementation of the reverseIndex application.

== Build ==

Change to the version directory you want to compile and execute:

	mvn clean package

All the .jar files needed by the application will be automatically generated.

== Dependencies ==

For compilation and/or execution there are some jars listed in the maven dependencies, theyare automatically downloaded. 

* htmlparser.jar

== Scripts usage ==

Interactive script: launch.sh

Although we showed how to execute an application with runcompss in each subdirectory,
we strongly recommend to use the available bash scripts on the top of each application directory.
To run an application with the scripts, do the following:

        cd /PATH_TO_JAVA_APPS/reverseIndex   # change directory to the application top directory
        ./launch.sh VERSION_TO_EXECUTE IMPLEMENTATION_TO_EXECUTION APP_ARGS # VERSION_TO_EXECUTE it is 'base' in case that the version is '1_base'

TODO: SLURM jobscript: launch_mn.sh
