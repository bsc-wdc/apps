== Implementations ==

wordcount.multipleFiles :

	Performs a distributed wordcount from multiple
	files within the same folder.

wordcount.multipleFilesDiffFolders :

	Performs a distributed wordcount of multiple files
	stored in different folders within a main folder.

wordcount.multipleFilesNTimes :

	Performs a distributed wordcount of multiple files 
	within the same folder. Each file is considered N times.

wordcount.multipleFilesReadWriteTasks :

	Performs a distributed wordcount of multiple files (like version 1)
	but performs the file reading and result writting as tasks.

wordcount.uniqueFile :

	Perform a distributed wordcount from a single file. Splits the file
	into blocks of N bytes (this version does not check if a word is splitted).

== Execution instructions ==
Usage:
runcompss wordcount.multipleFiles.Wordcount <DATA_FOLDER> <OUTPUT_FOLDER> <OUTPUT_FILE_NAME>
runcompss wordcount.multipleFilesDiffFolders.Wordcount <DATA_FOLDER> <OUTPUT_FOLDER> <OUTPUT_FILE_NAME>
runcompss wordcount.multipleFilesNTimes.Wordcount <DATA_FOLDER> <OUTPUT_FOLDER> <OUTPUT_FILE_NAME> <N_TIMES>
runcompss wordcount.multipleFilesReadWriteTasks.Wordcount <DATA_FOLDER> <OUTPUT_FOLDER> <OUTPUT_FILE_NAME>
runcompss wordcount.uniqueFile.Wordcount <DATA_FILE> <OUTPUT_FOLDER> <OUTPUT_FILE_NAME> <BLOCK_SIZE>

Where:
                 * - DATA_FOLDER: Absolute path to the base folder of the dataset files
                 * - OUTPUT_FOLDER: Absolute path where to store the results
                 * - OUTPUT_FILE_NAME: File name of the output file.
                 * - N_TIMES: Number of times to process each file
                 * - DATA_FILE: Absolute path to the dataset file
                 * - BLOCK_SIZE: Number of bytes of each block
