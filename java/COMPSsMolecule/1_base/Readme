[Body]
 == Description ==
This application computes the center of mass of the summation of a set of molecules
by means of a reduction operation.

The reduction is made using recursion.

The method used for adding two molecules is a COMPSs parallel task.
 
The application uses Persistent Objects library developed by the Storage Systems research group at BSC-CNS.
