[Body]
 == Description ==
Sort an input of the form {key, value} by key. 
You will find several datasets in the apps directory.

== Versions ==
There is only one version of terasort, but different
implementations can be found inside this one.

== Build ==

The .jar files are build with Maven.

cd /PATH_TO_JAVA_APPS/terasort/
mvn clean package

== Scripts usage ==

Interactive script: launch.sh

Although we showed how to execute an application with runcompss in each subdirectory,
we strongly recommend to use the available bash scripts on the top of each application directory.
To run an application with the scripts, do the following:

        cd /PATH_TO_JAVA_APPS/terasort   # change directory to the application top directory
        ./launch.sh VERSION_TO_EXECUTE IMPLEMENTATION_TO_EXECUTE APP_ARGS # VERSION_TO_EXECUTE it is 'base' in case that the version is '1_base'
