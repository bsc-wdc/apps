[Body]
== Description ==
Example of a simple application with only one task.

The application stores a counter value in a file, increments that counter in a task method (''increment'') and then prints the final value in the main program.

== Build ==
=== Option 1: Native java ===
cd /PATH_TO_JAVA_APPS/simple/1_base; javac src/main/java/simple/*.java
cd src/main/java/; jar cf simple.jar simple/
cd ../../../; mkdir jar; mv src/main/java/simple.jar jar/

=== Option 2: Maven ===
cd ~/workspace_java/simple/
mvn clean package

== Execution instructions ==
Usage:
runcompss simple.Simple <counterValue>

where:
                 * - counterValue: Initial value of the counter to increase

== Execution Example ==

runcompss simple.Simple 1

For a deeper knowledge of what runcompss is capable of, try: runcompss -h 

== Scripts usage ==

Although we showed how to execute an application with runcompss, we strongly
recommend to use the available bash scripts on the top of each application directory.
To run an application with the scripts, do the following:

	cd /PATH_TO_JAVA_APPS/simple   # change directory to the application top directory
	./launch.sh VERSION_TO_EXECUTE # VERSION_TO_EXECUTE it is 'base' in case that the version is '1_base'
