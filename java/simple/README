[Body]
== Description ==
Example of a simple application with only one task. The application stores a counter value in a file,
increments that counter in a task method (''increment'') and then prints the final value in the main program.

== Versions ==
Simple has only one single version, the increment is performed in a file.

== Build ==

The .jar files are build with Maven.

cd /PATH_TO_JAVA_APPS/simple/
mvn clean package

== Scripts usage ==

Although we show how to execute an application with runcompss in each subdirectory, 
we strongly recommend to use the available bash scripts on the top of each application directory.
To run an application with the scripts, do the following:

	cd /PATH_TO_JAVA_APPS/simple   # change directory to the application top directory
	./launch.sh VERSION_TO_EXECUTE # VERSION_TO_EXECUTE it is 'base' in case that the version is '1_base'
