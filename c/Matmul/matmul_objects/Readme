== Description ==
Matrix multiplication is a binary operation that takes a pair of matrices and produces another matrix.

If A is an n×m matrix and B is an m×p matrix, the result AB of their multiplication is an n×p matrix defined only if the number of columns m in A is equal to the number of rows m in B. When multiplying A and B, the elements of the rows in A are multiplied with corresponding columns in B.

In this implementation, A and B are square matrices (same number of rows and columns), and so it is the result matrix C. Each matrix is divided in N blocks of M doubles. The multiplication of two blocks is done by a multiply task method with a simple three-nested-loop implementation. When executed with COMPSs, the main program generates N^3^ tasks arranged as N^2^ chains of N tasks in the dependency graph.


== Execution instructions ==
Usage:
runcompss --lang=c /home/compss/tutorial_apps/c/matmul_objects/master/Matmul <numberOfBlocks> <blockSize> <initVal>

where:
		 * - numberOfBlocks: Number of blocks inside each matrix
		 * - blockSize: Size of each block
		 * - initVal: double value for the matrix initialization


== Execution Example ==
runcompss --lang=c /home/compss/tutorial_apps/c/matmul_objects/master/Matmul 8 4 12.34


== Build ==
buildapp Matmul
